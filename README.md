## Project description
Apomixis is an interesting object for study because of the huge potential
of its use in plants selection. This phylogenetic research of several species
of the Brassicaceae family was performed in order to study genes associated
with asexual reproduction through seeds. The main emphasis of the work was
placed on the evolution through duplications and the identifcation of paralogs
responsible for apomixis-related functions.
## Goals  
* Perform a comparative phylogenetics assay of the genomes of seven plants  
* Find the patterns between specific genes and apomixis plant-forms  
* Find orthologues genes in other representatives of the Brassicaceae family  
* Build the trees of genes of interests
## Methods
* Aligning proteins of interests to proteoms of 7 Brassicaceae species. 
* Multialigning of groups of proteins of interest.
* NJ tree building.
* MrBayes tree building.
